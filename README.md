# Shana's SQL Portfolio!
## SQL Projects Showcase 
#### As a beginner data analyst, I've curated a collection of projects that demonstrate my skills in querying, analyzing, and manipulating data using SQL. From simple queries to more complex database management tasks, explore how I apply SQL to extract insights and solve real-world problems.
##### Feel free to take a look and let me know if you have any questions, you can also find me on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shana-lawson-ferdinand-a97a8a130/)!
